# Liang_Index_climdyn

This github repository provides the codes for computing the transfer of information between variables:
- function_liang.py allows to compute the transfer of information from variable x2 to variable x1 based on Liang (2014)
- function_liang_nvar.py allows to compute the transfer of information for multivariate time series based on Liang (2021).

If you use this code, please cite the following paper:
